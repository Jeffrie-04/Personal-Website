                <h4>About Me:</h4>
                <p>I'm Latino first generation college student pursing a computer science degree at Stony Brook University. Currently a 
                    college freshman just finished my first semester with a 3.5 GPA. During high school, I was learnig code on my own using 
                    resoures like Youtube, Udemey, Codeacademy and many other things. To prepare my self in my journey in college with my high 
                    school having classes to teach us how to code. My end goal is to become a full time Software Engineer or anything dealing 
                    with using my programming skills.</p></td>
